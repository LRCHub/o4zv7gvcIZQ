When I'm alone, tomorrow feels far away.
And I must go over still into the darkness of dawn.

If I try to play it straight, it will no doubt fail,
And tonight it won't go well between us again.

You can't see all of my hard efforts, because it's only result
Is that it makes no sense. It really is a "tightrope".

More effort, more damage--this is my daily life.
Taking a cynical attitude may give me some comfort...

Hiding myself, heated and irritated; living only a short time.

When I'm alone, tomorrow feels far away.
And I must go over still into the darkness of dawn.

If I let my emotions free,
My dreams will once again not go well.

I think the balance sheet of my life is imperfect.
If I add up the plusses and minuses, will it really equal zero?

I want to control all my luck
That may be used up before my life is ended.

You don't know--you can change logic at your will.

I hurt myself because of you, over and over;
But my love didn't go away--it kept coming back.

The toughness gained from my damage is unbelievable.
I won't be able to sleep at all tonight either.

However many times it's repeated,.
It revives again and again--because it's love.

You can't blame my emotion,
Because you should know it will never fade away.

When I'm alone, tomorrow feels far away.
And even though I'm in the darkness of dawn, I have to go.

I don't care about "bad affinity". Even if our love is not doing well,
Nevertheless we have deep ties.
